This repository contains a React Native app demonstrating a common issue where FlatList fails to render data after a successful API call.  The bug occurs because of a missing `keyExtractor` function in FlatList, even though the data is fetched correctly and the app doesn't throw errors. The solution demonstrates how to fix this issue using `keyExtractor` and also shows error handling for failed API calls.
